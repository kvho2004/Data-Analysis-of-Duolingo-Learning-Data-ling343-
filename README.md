Questions for Exploration:

1. How effective is the spaced repetition approach employed by Duolingo?

2. Are there any patterns in user performance based on time since the last practice?

3. Does the user interface language affect the user's performance?

4. What are the most challenging lexemes for users?

5. Is there any correlation between the user's history with a word and their performance in the current session?

Summary: Main Findings

The spaced repetition approach employed by Duolingo appears effective, as indicated by high proportions of correct word recalls.

User performance tends to decrease slightly with longer intervals since the last practice session, suggesting better performance with shorter intervals. Users generally perform better with shorter spaced repetition time intervals, implying improved learning outcomes with consistent study sessions.

The user interface language has minimal impact on user performance, with subtle differences observed among languages. However, users with Italian set as their UI language exhibit slightly better performance.

The most challenging words for users include nouns, verbs, and gender distinctions, suggesting difficulty with these concepts.

There's a slight negative correlation between a user's history with a word and their performance in the current session, indicating the need for more repetitions for certain words. On average, however, for each user, users tend to perform well in current sessions when they excel in previous ones, regardless of language or UI language.
